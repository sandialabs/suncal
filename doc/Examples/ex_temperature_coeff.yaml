- description: 'A resistor was calibrated at one temperature but used at another.
    This calculation determines the resistance and its uncertainty at the temperature
    of use.


    The units for T and T0 are absolute temperature, entered as "degC" in the units
    column, but their uncertainties are temperature differences, entered as "delta_degC"
    in the units column. Subtraction of the two absolute temperatures results in a
    delta temperature.'
