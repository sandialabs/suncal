- description: "Example from the original 1953 Kline-McClintock uncertainty paper\
    \ on which the GUM is based, and discussed again in NIST 1900 Example E3.\n\n\
    Here, the built-in units conversions are used with the original units given by\
    \ Kline-McClintock. Note that air temperature is an absolute temperature (fahrenheit),\
    \ while its uncertainty is a delta temperature (\u0394fahrenheit). Uncertainties\
    \ were given at 95% (\"20 to 1 odds\"). "
