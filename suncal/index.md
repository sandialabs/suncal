# Suncal Web Interface

The Suncal-Web interface currently provides these tools as a beta-test:

## Suncal Web Apps (beta)

- [Uncertainty Calculator](uncert/index.html): Calculate Type A, Type B, GUM and Monte Carlo Propagation, and curve fitting uncertainties.
- [Measurement Decision Risk Calculator](risk/index.html): Calculate global and specific risk, probability of conformance, and generate risk curves.
- [End-to-end Measurement Quality Assurance](mqa/index.html): Calculate risks, reliabilitiy, intervals, and cost optimization.

- [Distribution Explorer](distributions.html): Sample from probability distributions and combine using Monte Carlo (typically for training purposes).
- [Student T Calculator](student.html): Calculate coverage factor, level of confidence, and degrees of freedom
- [Units Converter](units.html): Convert between measurement units

## About

The Suncal-Web apps use either [pyscript](https://pyscript.net) or Rust.All data and calculations stay in your browser.
Source code for this website and the web interface can be found on [github](https://github.com/sandialabs/suncal/tree/gh-pages),
and may be self-hosted with any static web server.

Suncal-Web is still under active development and beta testing.
