# Suncal Web Interface

The Suncal-Web interface currently provides these tools as a beta-test:

- [Decision Risk Calculator](risk.html): Calculate probability of false accept and reject
- [Decision Risk Curves](riskcurves.html): Generate plots of decision risk versus guardbanding, in-tolerance probability, or TURs
- [Student T Calculator](student.html): Calculate coverage factor, level of confidence, and degrees of freedom
- [Units Converter](units.html): Convert between measurement units

Additional web implementations of features from the full Suncal package are in development.

## About

The Suncal-Web interface runs the same back-end code as the full [desktop](../index.html) version, but using
a [pyscript](https://pyscript.net)-based user interface. All data and calculations stay in your browser.
Source code for this website and the web interface can be found on [github](https://github.com/sandialabs/suncal/tree/gh-pages).

Suncal-Web is still under active development and considered in beta testing.
