# Suncal Web Interface

The Suncal-Web interface currently provides these tools as a beta-test:

- [Student T Calculator](student.html): Calculate coverage factor, level of confidence, and degrees of freedom
- [Units Converter](units.html): Convert between measurement units

Additional web implementations of features from the full Suncal package are in development.

## About

The Suncal-Web interface runs the same back-end code as the full [desktop](../index.html) version, but using
a [pyscript](https://pyscript.net)-based user interface. All data and calculations stay in your browser. UI code is available here.

Suncal-Web is still under active development and considered in beta testing.
